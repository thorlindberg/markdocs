**Distributed Computing**

In characterising distributed systems, {"cite":"kshemkalyani2011distributed"} raise the notion that the physical differences of entities, and variation in their resources, creates a reliance on distributed communication. Distributed resources, particularly the absence of shared memory, implies an inherent asynchrony between entities {"citep":"kshemkalyani2011distributed"}. This means that each individual entity must act autonomously, while collaborating with and distributing tasks among the entities within the system {"citep":"kshemkalyani2011distributed","page":"246"}.

See {"ref":"distributedsystem"}.
